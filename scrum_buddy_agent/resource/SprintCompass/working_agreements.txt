Team Working Agreement – Sprint Compass

Communication:
- Daily standup at 09:00 local time for all team members.
- PM and PO will respond to async clarifications within 2 hours.
- Slack/Teams channels are monitored actively during core hours.

Development Workflow:
- Branch naming: feature/<JIRA-ID>, bug/<JIRA-ID>, chore/<task>
- All PRs require at least 1 reviewer.
- Developers include unit + basic integration tests with each PR.
- API contract changes must be documented and shared before implementation.

QA & Testing:
- QA is involved at story kickoff and attends all refinement sessions.
- Shared test data must be updated in the central repository.
- Regression tests run nightly.

Meeting Norms:
- Cameras optional but recommended for sprint ceremonies.
- Keep discussions focused; deep dives move to follow-up sessions.
- Respect everyone’s time — start and end meetings on schedule.

Definition of Done (DoD):
- Acceptance criteria fulfilled
- PR reviewed and approved
- Tests passing (unit, integration, regression if required)
- QA validated
- Documentation updated if applicable
